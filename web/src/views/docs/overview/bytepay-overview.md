Pay to coders, coding to earn! Sell opensource product~

# Why BytePay

- So many open source developers are too poor!
- Developers can't support themselves through open-source, so that they have to be hired by some companies
- Many excellent open-source projects have no business model.

Open source projects can't support themselves, resulting in the deletion of libraries, like https://github.com/marak/Faker.js/ ...

# What is BytePay

Bytepay is a platform that supports paid tasks to complete open-source projects on Github.

You can initiate open-source tasks and pay with DOT tokens (for example, you can initiate paid collaboration tasks when you encounter difficulties in architecture construction, requirements analysis, document construction, and testing). Those who complete the tasks as required can receive tokens after the task initiator verifies that the tasks are completed.

# Workflow

For example, Alice is an open-source project owner, Bob is a developer, Alice create a paid task and Bob finished it then got the reward.

- Alice(Project owner) recharge crypto in [BytePay](https://bytepay.online)
- Alice active an opensource project on BytePay, then create paid task though issue.
- Bob applies the task and completes it.
- Alice pays for Bob though issue.
- Bob now can withdraw crypto in [BytePay](https://bytepay.online).
